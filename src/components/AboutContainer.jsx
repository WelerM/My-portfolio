            <p>
                With over three years of experience studying technology, I have been combining university studies with independent learning in programming. While programming remains my primary focus, I am also deeply interested in diverse IT domains such as cybersecurity, cloud computing, and system architecture, exploring their impact on modern industries. This broad focus helps me stay updated with evolving trends and enhances my ability to contribute meaningfully to various challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have completed several projects involving the development of systems that solve
                diverse problems, gaining hands-on experience with <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>PHP</strong>, and <strong>SQL</strong>. My
                ongoing learning includes modern technologies such as <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Node.js</strong>, as well as
                exploring <strong>AI tools</strong> and <strong>frameworks</strong>. I aim to integrate AI-driven approaches into my work
                to create smarter, more efficient solutions.
